- 👋 Hi, I’m **Atharv Awasthi**
- 👀 In the past, I have taken high school **Java** classes through John's Hopkins University, completed independent research using Mathematica software, and helped program for GA's Robotics Team (go 8637A!!)
- 🌱 Everyone in my immediate family codes, which has nurtured my interest in coding and in **ATCS**
- 💞️ Other interests of mine include mathematics, teaching, running, building things, and playing poker (gamble-free, *of course*)
- 📫 My goal for this class is to complete innovative projects and adopt skills which will complement my future research
